- "30-40" means "$30,000-$40,000" or "$30k-$40k"
- "50k" means "$50,000"
Always normalize budget values to include the "k" suffix (e.g., "$20k", "$30k-$40k", "under $25k").
CRITICAL: For slots with ALLOWED VALUES, you MUST use one of the listed values exactly as written. Map user input to the closest allowed value (e.g., "gas" → "Gasoline", "truck" → "Pickup", "SUV" → "SUV").""",

    "laptops": """IMPORTANT: For electronics, prices are typically in HUNDREDS of dollars.
- "under 500" means "$500"
- "1000-2000" means "$1,000-$2,000"
Always include the dollar sign in budget values.
CRITICAL: For slots with ALLOWED VALUES, you MUST use one of the listed values exactly as written. Map user input to the closest allowed value (e.g., "screen" → "monitor", "graphics card" → "gpu", "PC" → "desktop", "Mac" → product_type "laptop" + brand "Apple", "earbuds" → "headphones").""",

CRITERIA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a smart extraction agent for the '{domain}' domain.

Extract ALL criteria from the user's message into the EXACT slot names listed below.

AVAILABLE SLOTS (use these EXACT slot_name strings — never invent new ones):
{schema_text}

{price_context}

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Use EXACTLY the slot names shown above. Never use aliases:
   - CORRECT: slot_name="min_ram_gb"  (NOT "ram", "ram_gb", "memory")
   - CORRECT: slot_name="budget"       (NOT "price", "max_price", "price_range")
   - CORRECT: slot_name="screen_size"  (NOT "display", "screen", "display_size")

2. Extract from the ENTIRE message — scan every phrase, not just the first sentence.
   A message like "16GB RAM, SSD, under $1,000" contains THREE slots to extract.

3. Brand EXCLUSIONS (user says "no X", "not X", "refuse X", "hate X", "avoid X", "anything but X"):
   → slot_name="excluded_brands", value="Brand1" or "Brand1,Brand2" for multiple.
   Examples: "no HP" → excluded_brands="HP" | "no HP and no Acer" → excluded_brands="HP,Acer"

4. OS requirements ("Windows 10", "Linux only", "must have macOS"):
   → slot_name="os", value="Windows 10" etc.

5. For slots with ALLOWED VALUES, map the user's words to the closest allowed value exactly.

6. Only extract what is explicitly stated or clearly inferable. Do NOT guess.

Also detect user intent signals:
- is_impatient: true if user wants to skip questions ("just show me", "whatever", "skip", "I don't care")
- wants_recommendations: true if user explicitly asks for recommendations ("show me options", "what do you recommend")

Return ALL matching slots from a single message. A message with 4 criteria → return 4 SlotValues.

# Question Generation (IDSS-style with invitation pattern)

QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are a helpful {assistant_type} assistant gathering preferences to make great recommendations.

## Current Knowledge
{slot_context}

## CRITICAL RULE
Your question MUST end with an invitation to share the topics listed in "Invite input on". This is required, not optional.

## Question Format
1. Main question about '{slot_display_name}'
2. Quick replies (2-4 options) for that topic only
3. ALWAYS end with: "Feel free to also share [topics from 'Invite input on']"

## Examples

Example 1 (vehicles - budget with other HIGH topics):
Context: "Invite input on: Primary Use, Body Style"
Question: "What's your budget range? Feel free to also share what you'll primarily use the vehicle for or what body style you prefer."
Quick replies: ["Under $20k", "$20k-$35k", "$35k-$50k", "Over $50k"]

Example 2 (laptops - use case with other topics):
Context: "Invite input on: Budget, Brand"
Question: "What will you primarily use the laptop for? Feel free to also share your budget or any brand preferences."
Quick replies: ["Work/Business", "Gaming", "School/Study", "Creative Work"]

Example 3 (books - genre with other topics):
Context: "Invite input on: Format"
Question: "What genre of book are you in the mood for? Feel free to also mention if you prefer a specific format."
Quick replies: ["Fiction", "Mystery/Thriller", "Sci-Fi/Fantasy", "Non-Fiction"]

Generate ONE question. Topic: {slot_name}. Remember: ALWAYS include the invitation at the end."""

# Recommendation Explanation

RECOMMENDATION_EXPLANATION_PROMPT = """You are a friendly {domain} shopping assistant presenting recommendations.

Write a SHORT message that presents each product as a concise bullet point:
• One bullet per product (use the • character).
• Each bullet: product name — 1 short sentence highlighting its best quality or key stat (price, spec, use case).
• End with a one-sentence "Best pick:" line naming your top recommendation and why.
• After the "Best pick:" line, add a "⚠️ Trade-off:" sentence mentioning 1 real limitation (price, RAM, battery, mixed reviews) if one clearly exists. Omit entirely if the product is strong across the board.

Rules:
- Use the • bullet character (not dashes or numbers).
- Keep each bullet to 1–2 short sentences maximum.
- Do NOT write long prose paragraphs — bullet points only.
- Do NOT repeat the user's criteria verbatim.
- Sound warm and direct, like a knowledgeable friend."""

   Examples: "show me something cheaper", "I want a different brand", "what about under $500", "show me Dell instead", "I need more storage", "something with better reviews"

2. "domain_switch" — The user wants to switch to a completely different product category.
   Examples: "actually show me books instead", "I want to look at laptops now", "switch to vehicles", "help me find a car"

3. "new_search" — The user wants to start fresh within the same domain with entirely new criteria.
   Examples: "actually I want a gaming laptop instead of a work one", "forget that, show me mystery novels", "start over but for SUVs"

4. "action" — The user wants to perform a specific action on the current recommendations (research, compare, checkout, rate, see similar).

5. "other" — Greeting, off-topic, or unclear intent.
