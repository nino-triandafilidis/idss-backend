Comparison Agent — LLM-powered narrative comparison of recommended products.

Called when the user asks to compare recommendations (e.g. "compare my options",
"which one is better for gaming?", "pros and cons") after recommendations have
been shown.

Uses the same OpenAI client pattern as universal_agent.py.
