## Patterns

1. **Hard pass rate** is the fraction of recommended products that satisfy *all* hard constraints in expected_ucp (e.g. price_max_cents, brand, min_ram_gb, min/max_screen_size, good_for_*). It is often 0 because search (with relaxation) may return products that miss one or more of these constraints. Improving filter application or catalog coverage would increase hard pass rate.

2. **Mean similarity** measures how close recommended products are to the ground-truth set in embedding space (1 = closest). Merchant Agent typically outperforms the baseline when the Shopping Agent produces better-aligned filters.

3. **Shopping Agent (query→UCP) match rate** is key-wise agreement between produced filters and expected_ucp; mismatches often come from brand/screen/ram interpretation (e.g. agent says 14.0–14.5", expected 13.5–14.5").
