G-Eval v2 — IDSS Merchant Agent Evaluator
==========================================
Hybrid evaluation: deterministic rule-based checks (response type, brand
exclusions, filter presence) combined with an LLM quality judge that evaluates
BEHAVIOUR, not product-spec matching.

Key improvements over v1:
  - Deterministic checks for response type, brand exclusions, filter extraction
  - LLM judge scoped to response QUALITY only (not product catalog coverage)
  - Few-shot calibration examples anchoring 0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0
  - Chain-of-thought reasoning before score to reduce hallucinated numbers
  - Async parallel execution: all 160 agent queries run concurrently (semaphore=6)
  - All 160 scoring calls run concurrently after
  - Comparison mode: --baseline FILE shows delta vs previous run
  - Score distribution histogram in output
  - Difficulty split: "Specified" (expect recs on first msg) vs "Underspecified"

Usage:
    python scripts/run_geval.py
    python scripts/run_geval.py --url http://localhost:8000
    python scripts/run_geval.py --save results_v2.json
    python scripts/run_geval.py --baseline scripts/geval_results_20260314_161644.json
    python scripts/run_geval.py --verbose

Evaluating Sajjad's idss-mcp endpoint:
    python scripts/run_geval.py --sajjad-url                            # uses localhost:9003
    python scripts/run_geval.py --sajjad-url http://myhost:9003         # custom host
    python scripts/run_geval.py --sajjad-url --save geval_sajjad.json   # save results

  --sajjad-url is a convenience shortcut that overrides --url and implies --no-kg.
  Sajjad's /chat endpoint must accept the same JSON body:
    { "message": str, "session_id": str }
  and return the same response schema as IDSS:
    { "message": str, "response_type": str, "recommendations": [...],
      "filters": {...}, "kg_results": [...] }
  If the response format differs, run_geval.py will silently score missing fields as 0.

Four-system comparison (after running all evals):
    python scripts/compare_evals.py \\
        --idss    scripts/geval_results_ours.json \\
        --sajjad  scripts/geval_results_sajjad.json \\
        --gpt     scripts/geval_results_gpt.json \\
        --perplexity scripts/geval_results_pplx.json

# ============================================================================
# LLM Judge — quality scoring only (not product spec matching)
# ============================================================================

GEVAL_SYSTEM = """\
You are an expert evaluator for IDSS, an AI shopping assistant for laptops.

== CRITICAL RULE ==
The agent queries a FIXED product database. If it cannot find a laptop with
an exact spec (e.g. RTX 4060, 1440p 165Hz), it returns the closest available
products. DO NOT PENALIZE for imperfect product matches — the catalog is limited.
Evaluate the AGENT'S REASONING AND BEHAVIOUR, not catalog coverage.

== YOUR JOB ==
Score the QUALITY of the agent's response on a 0–10 point scale.

== CALIBRATION ANCHORS ==
10/10  Perfect: correct response type, fully helpful, great tone, no errors.
 8/10  Good: helpful and constructive, minor omissions or small verbosity.
 6/10  Acceptable: partially addresses the query, some issues.
 4/10  Weak: off on some key point but shows basic competence.
 2/10  Poor: misses the point, unhelpful, or major factual error.
 0/10  Failure: empty, crashes, or completely wrong.

== QUALITY RUBRIC (reason through each before scoring) ==

Step 1 — ENGAGEMENT (0–4 pts):
  Does the response constructively address the user's actual situation?
  • 4: Fully engages with context, adds useful insight or empathy
  • 2: Partially engages, misses one aspect
  • 0: Ignores the key request

Step 2 — TONE CALIBRATION (0–3 pts):
  Does the tone match the user's communication style?
  • 3: Perfect match (technical for experts, simple for non-tech, empathetic for frustrated)
  • 2: Mostly appropriate
  • 1: Slightly off
  • 0: Clearly wrong tone

Step 3 — ACCURACY & COHERENCE (0–3 pts):
  Does it avoid factual errors and irrelevant content?
  • 3: No errors; coherent; all claims are reasonable
  • 2: Minor issues
  • 1: One clear factual problem
  • 0: Major factual error (e.g. "Final Cut Pro works on Windows" or "1TB RAM exists")

== FEW-SHOT CALIBRATION EXAMPLES ==

Example A (score 9/10):
  User: "need latop for school. budget arond 500 bucks. nothin too heavy"
  Agent: "Got it! Here are some lightweight laptops under $500 great for school: [3 laptops shown]"
  → Engagement: 3 (understood typos, acknowledged budget), Tone: 3 (casual), Accuracy: 3 = 9

Example B (score 5/10):
  User: "my work gives me $3,000 for a laptop. i want to spend all of it."
  Agent: "What will you use it for?" [only question, no recs]
  → Engagement: 1 (has enough info for recs but only asks), Tone: 2, Accuracy: 2 = 5

Example C (score 2/10):
  User: "can any of these run Final Cut Pro? i edit YouTube videos."
  Agent: "Yes! Here are Windows laptops that run Final Cut Pro: [Windows recs]"
  → Engagement: 1, Tone: 2, Accuracy: 0 (Final Cut Pro is Mac-only) = 3 → score 0.3

== OUTPUT ==
First write a brief reasoning (2–3 sentences, one per step).
Then output EXACTLY this JSON on the last line:
{"score": <0-10>, "reason": "<≤12 words summarizing the key issue>"}

    Weighted combination of five scoring components.

    Weight rationale (engineering heuristics, not empirically optimized):
      40% — Response type (deterministic, highest weight):
             Choosing the *right action* (give recs vs ask a question) is the most
             critical behavior. An agent that gives unsolicited recs to "laptop" (one
             word) fails fundamentally, regardless of response quality.
      20% — Brand exclusions (deterministic, only when applicable):
             Brand exclusion is a HARD constraint — showing an HP laptop when user
             said "no HP" is a critical failure. Gets 20% when the query has
             must_not_contain_brands; redistributes to quality when N/A.
      10% — Filter extraction (deterministic, soft signal):
             Verifies budget/RAM were correctly parsed. Soft (partial credit); lower
             weight because missed filters are recoverable (agent can still ask).
       5% — Availability (deterministic, only when recommendations present):
             Never recommend out-of-stock products. Small weight because our store
             mostly filters them already; redistributes to quality when N/A.
      25% — LLM quality score (engagement + tone + accuracy):
             Covers everything deterministic checks don't: empathy, correctness of
             advice, tone matching (casual vs technical), handling misconceptions.

    Effective weights for most queries (no brand exclusion, no filter check):
      type=40%, stock=5% (if recs), quality=55%  (w_quality = 1.0 - 0.40 - 0.05)
    Without recs: type=40%, quality=60%

    If a component is N/A (None), its weight redistributes entirely to quality.
