Multi-Turn G-Eval Harness — 5-Way Fair Comparison
===================================================
Tests IDSS, GPT-4o-mini (catalog-bound), Gemini-2.0-flash (catalog-bound),
Perplexity sonar (⚠ web-augmented, informational), and Sajjad's idss-mcp on 10
scripted 3–5 turn conversation scenarios covering constraint accumulation,
mind-changes, brand exclusion persistence, and preference tracking.

Systems:
  IDSS        sequential /chat calls to live server (session state enforces constraints)
  Sajjad      same /chat API, different server (localhost:9003 by default)
  GPT         catalog-bound gpt-4o-mini — before EACH turn, searches the IDSS product
              catalog via /chat and injects top-10 results so GPT recommends from the
              SAME product pool as IDSS (fair comparison).
  Gemini      catalog-bound gemini-2.0-flash — same catalog injection design as GPT.
              Uses GPT-4o-mini as judge (not Gemini) to avoid self-preference bias.
              Uses role "model" (not "assistant") in conversation history per Gemini API.
  Perplexity  ⚠ sonar (web-augmented) — informational only. All Perplexity API
              models use live web search; no offline variant exists. Per mentor:
              "The baseline shouldn't use web search." Excluded from primary ranking.

Fairness design (per mentor feedback — Negin Golrezaei + Hannah Clay):
  "If we don't give [GPT] our database, how can we even compare?" — answered by
  catalog injection for GPT and Gemini. Perplexity cannot be made fair (web search is
  mandatory in their API). Primary fair comparison: IDSS vs GPT vs Gemini vs Sajjad.

Scoring (v3 — catalog-bound GPT/Gemini + judge-hallucination-resistant):
  45% judge       GPT-4o-mini evaluates full transcript; explicitly told not to penalize
                  silent constraint enforcement (DB/search filtering).
                  All systems judged by the SAME GPT-4o-mini judge for comparability.
  55% constraint  Deterministic checks: brand exclusions, brand presence, budget.
                  GPT/Gemini have structured products from catalog matching.
                  Text-based checks only for Perplexity (no structured output).

Usage:
    python scripts/run_multiturn_geval.py --url http://localhost:8001
    python scripts/run_multiturn_geval.py --systems idss,gpt,gemini,sajjad
    python scripts/run_multiturn_geval.py --systems idss,gpt --save scripts/geval_multiturn.json

MULTITURN_JUDGE_SYSTEM = """\
You are evaluating a MULTI-TURN laptop shopping assistant conversation.

CRITICAL FAIRNESS RULE — READ BEFORE SCORING:
Systems may enforce constraints SILENTLY through database or search filtering rather than
verbally. Do NOT deduct points for lack of verbal acknowledgment.
Check only whether the final PRODUCTS LIST complies with stated constraints.
Example: User said "no HP" → no HP products appear in Products list → FULL marks for that
constraint regardless of whether the assistant said "I'm excluding HP as requested."

SCORE FLOOR: If the Products list shows all recommendations comply with stated constraints
(no excluded brands, prices within budget, correct use-case), Constraint Satisfaction
score MUST be at least 3 out of 4. Reserve 0 for complete failure on a constraint.

Score the entire conversation from 0–10 based on these criteria:

1. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0–4 points):
   Did the assistant honor ALL constraints stated across all turns in the final response?
   Constraints include: budget limits, brand exclusions, OS requirements, use-case specs,
   RAM/size requirements. Budget/spec updates must OVERWRITE prior values (not accumulate).
   Mind-changes (e.g., "actually HP is fine") must reverse the prior constraint.
   − 2 pts per violated hard constraint FOUND IN THE PRODUCTS LIST.
   − Do NOT deduct for constraints not echoed verbally if products comply.

2. PREFERENCE TRACKING (0–3 points):
   Did the assistant maintain preferences stated in earlier turns throughout the conversation?
   Did it correctly handle preference changes (pivots, exclusion reversals, budget updates)?
   Did it maintain context from prior recommendations when asked for comparison/follow-up?
   Give partial credit (1–2 pts) when some but not all preferences were tracked.

3. RESPONSE APPROPRIATENESS (0–3 points):
   Was each turn's response appropriate to the conversational context?
   − Ask clarifying questions when appropriate (vague query), not repeatedly.
   − Give recommendations when user is ready, not more questions.
   − Answer follow-up questions (battery, price, warranty) in context of prior products.
   − Acknowledge and act on explicit preference changes.

SCORE ANCHORS:
  9–10: All constraints satisfied in products, preference tracking perfect, turns coherent.
  6–8:  Most constraints satisfied, minor omissions in tracking or coherence.
  4–5:  Some constraints violated or several preferences missed, but reasonable effort.
  2–3:  Major constraint violations (wrong brand, over budget) or completely off-topic.
  0–1:  System completely failed — wrong category, all exclusions violated, or crash/error.

Write 3–4 sentences of reasoning covering all criteria.
Then output EXACTLY this JSON on the last line:
{"score": <0-10>, "reason": "<≤15 words summarizing main strength or failure>"}
